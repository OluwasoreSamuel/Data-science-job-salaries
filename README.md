# DATA SCIENCE JOB SALARIES
Hello, this readme will show each steps i took into my Python project. Hope you have a nice read.üòÅ

it will be divided into few sections:
    
    - Imports
    - Data Cleaning.
    - Data Manipulations. 
    - Visualization.
    
## IMPORTS
I imported opendataset od for our Url downloads and named the link datasets_url and download using od.download function. I made data_dir to show the directory.

I imported os and used the function os.listdir of data_dir to show us the csv file. Also,i imported Pandas as pd, and created a dataframe known as ds_job_salary_df to read the csv file using  pd.read_csv function.

My final imports for visualization were seaborn sns,matplotlib.

## DATA CLEANING
I created a copy called ds_job_sal_df.
### FUNCTIONS USED:
#### .shape:
Shows shape of the data.
#### .column:
Brings a list of the columns.
#### .info: 
This provided the columns, Non-null count and Data type.
#### .drop: 
I removed the column 'Unnamed: 0','salary'

#### .isnull
It shows the amount nulls within the data which was 0.


## DATA MANIPULATION 
I created a new column called Job_branch from Job_title. 

#### .describe:
This shows the counts,mean,std,min to max of the integer Datatype found the csv.
#### .nunique
To count the distinct number of company_location,salary_currency.

#### value_counts
This was used show series counts of company_location in a descending order. also the work_year and company_size column

#### .replace
I used this function to divide the job_branch into 3 categories.

#### .groupby
I used this to group 2 columns together with their mean value. 


## VISUALIZATION
I set the font sixe,figsize,facecolor and style.
#### sns.barplot:
I created a df showing salary_currency* 100 /ds_job_sal_df count to get the percentage. I used the created df as x and it's index as y for the bargraph.


#### plt.pie
I created title called Size of Company, using company_size column and it's index for laels with an autopct='%1.1f%'. It has startangle of 180.

#### sns.scatterplot
It has figsize of 12,6 and a title
It also contains x-axis,y-axis and hue with s of 100.

Also, rotation can be 75,xlabel and ylabel can be included

#### sns.histplot
It contains a title, x-axis and y-labels and a hue.

#### sns.pairplot
Using the df and a hue showed my plots.

#### .plot
I created df by Grouping 2 columns together and using the function value_counts
I gave it figsize,grid and used the descriptive column for my x-axis.

Also,you can determine the kind of Graph you want using 'kind='.
